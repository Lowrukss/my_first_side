        <strong>Chester Charles Bennington</strong> was an American singer and songwriter. He is best know for being lead vocal for 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park" target="_blank">Linkin Park</a><br>
        Apart from Linking Park, he was also singing for bands like:
        <ul>
            <li>Grey Daze,</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_Sunrise" target="_blank">Dead by Sunrise</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Temple_Pilots" target="_blank">Stone Temple Pilots</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album, <em>Hybrid Theory</em> (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success.
    The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of
     the few albums ever to achieve that many sales. Linkin Park's following studio albums, from <em>Meteora</em> (2003) to <em>One More Light</em> (2017), continued the band's success.

    Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009.
    He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, 
    Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).
